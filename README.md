Description
Challenge 10 involves creating a command-line Team Profile Generator. This full-scale project demonstrates my ability to utlize a full suite of tools, including HTML/Styling, to testing my code using the Jest, Node package.  

Installation
Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install Node packages Jest and Inquirer. 

Useage
The user launches the application by inputting the commage 'node index.js' into the command line. Then the user is guided through the profile generation process by a series of prompts, having the choices to add 'Manager', 'Engineer', and 'Intern' employees. Once satisfied with the amount of profiles created, an Index.html file is generated utilizing the user's input.  

Contributing
Feel free to message me if you have any ideas on how to make this better!

Test
There are separate test files for each role in order to confirm their functionality. Each role('Employee', 'Manager', 'Engineer', 'Intern') has their own test file in the __tests__ directory.
